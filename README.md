# NodeJS - MYSQL

The Node app contains REST API which is created with the help of Sequelize ORM and Express framework. This app includes advanced features like authentication and encrypting password. Further, I have included morgan module for logging the response time of API and helmet module to secure the node app from common security vulnerabilities.
